# Observable next-evidence acquisition

`scripts/scout_evidence_acquisition.py` is an optional standard-library helper
for fresh shadow experiments. It does not replace the live Scout fetcher, decide
candidate quality, launch code, or write files. A caller supplies already
sanitized public targets and enforces its cohort repository/revision constraints.

`fetch_source(url)` accepts only HTTPS `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs with an
exact 40-character commit and a safe path. Percent-encoded targets are excluded
in this initial interface. It makes one GET, without authentication, redirect,
retry, model call, or fallback. A response is source text only on HTTP 200,
complete bounded UTF-8 body. HTTP failure bodies remain digest/accounting data,
not source evidence. A short body inconsistent with Content-Length fails.

For success and failure it records HTTP status when observed, application body
bytes returned to the reader, digest of that observed body/prefix, completeness,
error class, and client elapsed time. A read-budget sentinel permits at most one
byte over the declared cap. These are not total network/TLS bytes; a connection
failure may have unobserved traffic. The 20-second default is a socket-operation
timeout, **not a hard total-wall deadline**. Experiments needing a hard deadline
must separately enforce and account for one, including incomplete observations.

`AcquisitionSession.acquire(url)` shares an identical response across arms,
including failures, for at most 64 requests. It reports logical requested GETs
and actual GETs separately. A cache hit incurs no additional observed GET cost;
the original latency is not a measured counterfactual uncached latency.
`costs()` includes failed/invalid targets and explicitly leaves model/owner
cost, pricing, wire bytes, and counterfactual latency unmeasured.

Use this in a newly declared protocol. Historical pilot records remain immutable:
re-fetching their missing target does not recover the historical failure cost or
turn development examples into a prospective cohort. Source acquisition alone
does not establish native correctness, independent adjudication, PR conversion,
miss rate, dollar savings, or superiority to a strong-model/rules comparator.

Offline transport/accounting checks:

```text
python -B -m unittest tests.test_scout_evidence_acquisition
```

The tests inject controlled responses to cover partial timeout/EOF, HTTP error
bodies, invalid UTF-8/targets/budgets, byte caps and cache accounting. They test
the reader's behavior, not remote availability or scientific utility.
